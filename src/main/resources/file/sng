Where is Mona?
She's long gone
Where is Mary?
She's taken her along
But they haven't put their mittens on
And there's fifteen feet of pure white snow?

Where is Michael?
Where is Mark?
Where is Mathew
Now it's getting dark?
Where is John? They are all out back 
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Would you please put down that telephone
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow

I waved to my neighbour
My neighbour waved to me
But my neighbour
Is my enemy
I kept waving my arms 
Till I could not see
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Is anybody 
Out there please?
It's too quiet in here
And I'm beginning to freeze
I've got icicles hanging 
From my knees
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow 

Is there anybody here who feels this low?
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Is it any wonder? 
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord 
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord 

Doctor, Doctor 
I'm going mad
This is the worst day
I've ever had
I can't remember
Ever feeling this bad
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Where's my nurse
I need some healing
I've been paralysed
By a lack of feeling
I can't even find
Anything worth stealing
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow

Is there anyone else here who doesn't know?
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow 

Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Raise your hands up to the sky
Is it any wonder? 
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord 
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord 
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!
